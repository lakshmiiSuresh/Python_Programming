# MIMEMultipart is a class used to create a message object that 
# can have multiple parts (e.g body , attachmnts) in MIME format
# It allows you to create a message with plaintext and HTML content,
# as well as attach files.

# MIMEText is a class used to create a MIME message object that represents plain text.
# It is typicallu used to set the body content of the email message.

# MIMEBase is a class used to create a MIME message object that represents  
# genetic binary attachment.
# it is used when you want to attach files (eg: images,documents) to the email message
